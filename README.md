# KNNRegression
Finding the MPG of car using KNN regression from Cars data set

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed
1)Pandas
2)Sklearn
3)Numpy
4)Scipy

I have used jupyter notebook for this project and the file is in .ipynb format
I have used the data set cars.csv which I have uploaded here .
In this project I am trying to find the "MPG" of a car using the features "Cylinders","Weight","Horsepower" using KNN regression.
Used the standard scalar in SKLearn to get the standardised values for predictors 
Used distance.euclidean from scipy to find the euclidean distance
